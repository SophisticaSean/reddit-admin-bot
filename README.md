## About Me
This is a reddit bot dedicated to moderating large subreddits. It is one of the only instances of where this API is used as described in the reddit API docs. Most other implementations mock the UI/API calls that aren't documented. Let me know if you have any questions. My end goal is to turn this project into a fully functional SDK for golang for the reddit api.
